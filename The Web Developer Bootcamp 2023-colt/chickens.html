        <h2>Chicken distribution</h2>
        The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
        India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
        junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be
        called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a
        sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
        their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced
        in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and
        literature.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt
        in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria
        and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from
        the 5th century BC.[7][8]
        Terminology

        In most breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen by his larger comb.

        Comb of a hen.
        An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[9][10]

        Other terms are:

        Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[11][12]
        Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
        Chick: a young chicken[13]
        Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[14]
        Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[15]
        Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[16]
        Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
        immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]
        Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[19]
        Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally a
        term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and
        scientific contexts, chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]

        In Australian vernacular English the word chook provides the generic term for the species (e.g. "a cooked chook"
        or "she keeps chooks"); which enables chicken to commonly retain its original sense of a young or recently
        hatched bird. Chick is then rarely used to mean chicken, but is mainly used in Merriam-Webster's "Sense 1b" viz.
        the young of any bird.

        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
        century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely
        used throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]

        <h3>Biology and habitat</h3>
        Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even
        animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28]

        The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken lived
        for 16 years, according to Guinness World Records.[30]

        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long, flowing tails and shiny,
        pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours
        than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has
        only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. Identification can be made by looking at the
        comb, or eventually by the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the
        male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour).

        Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on
        either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and
        throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds, these
        are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds that causes extra
        feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[31]

        Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of
        flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may
        occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
